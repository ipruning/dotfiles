Personal dotfiles and workstation bootstrap repo.

This repo is intentionally organized around **long-term stable semantics**:

- **`modules/` is the source of truth** for curated “meta-config”, reusable configuration modules, and configs that are *not* naturally dotfiles.
- **`home/` is a Mackup-managed snapshot tree**. It is the *materialized output* of backup/restore (i.e., copied in/out by Mackup). Treat it as “backed-up artifacts”, not the canonical authoring location.
- **`generated/` is disposable** for items with a regeneration path (completions/functions/plugins/docs).
  - `generated/plugins/` contains third-party ZSH plugins (git-ignored).
  - `generated/docs/<hostname>/` stores host-specific snapshots (brew/apps/extensions).

If you want to manage Agents / Skills / Prompts inside this repo, start from **`AGENTS.md`**.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- macOS (this repo currently contains a lot of macOS app configs: Karabiner, Aerospace, Mos, etc.)
- `git`
- Tasks assume:
  - `mise` (task runner)
  - `uv` (for `uvx mackup ...`)
  - `gum` (confirmation prompts)
- Task-specific:
  - `init`: `curl`, `jq`, and `op` (1Password CLI) for env injection
  - `backup` / `restore`: `mackup` (invoked via `uvx`, which will install it if missing)
- Optional:
  - `brew` (package installation; host snapshots live under `generated/docs/<hostname>/`)

### Clone

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
````

### Run tasks (preferred)

Tasks live in `.mise/tasks/*.sh`.

List tasks:

```bash
mise tasks
```

Run a task:

```bash
mise run init
mise run restore
mise run backup
mise run sync
mise run zsh-profile
```

If you do not use `mise`, you can also run the scripts directly:

```bash
./.mise/tasks/init.sh
./.mise/tasks/restore.sh
./.mise/tasks/backup.sh
./.mise/tasks/sync.sh
./.mise/tasks/zsh-profile.sh
```

> Notes:
>
> * Exact behavior is defined by the scripts themselves; this README documents the intended semantics and contract.

## Repository contract (the “do not drift” rules)

These are the invariants that keep the repo understandable over time:

1. **Authoring happens in `modules/`**

   * Add/edit your curated configs, templates, scripts, and “meta config” there.
   * Things in `modules/` should be reviewable, stable, and portable.

2. **`home/` is not canonical source**

   * `home/` is a Mackup storage target (a snapshot tree).
   * Prefer not to hand-edit files under `home/` unless you *explicitly* want to change what Mackup will back up/restore.

3. **`generated/` is safe to delete (when regeneratable)**

   * Shell completions/functions belong here and are regenerated by `sync`.
   * `generated/plugins/` contains third-party ZSH plugins (git-ignored, cloned by `init`).
   * `generated/docs/<hostname>/` stores host-specific snapshots.

4. **Secrets never enter Git**

   * Use `*.private.*` files that are ignored, or template files like `*.tpl.*`.
   * Keep machine-local secrets outside the repo whenever possible.

### `modules/`

Common patterns used in this repo:

* `modules/bin/` — personal CLI entrypoints / wrappers (e.g., python scripts and short commands)
* `modules/zsh/` — zsh modular config fragments + templates (private env template included)
* `modules/mackup/` — Mackup configuration (`.mackup.cfg` + per-app cfg fragments)
* `modules/surfingkeys/` — browser automation config (Surfingkeys)

### `home/`

`home/` mirrors real paths under `$HOME`, including:

* dotfiles: `.zshrc`, `.gitconfig`, etc.
* XDG configs: `.config/*`
* macOS app support paths: `Library/Application Support/*`, `Library/Preferences/*`

Because this directory is meant for **backup/restore materialization**, it may contain:

* files created/updated by apps
* timestamps / backups (which should typically be excluded/ignored)

If you see noise such as `.DS_Store` or auto-backups inside `home/`, prefer to ignore/exclude them to keep diffs meaningful.

## Workflows

### 1) Day-to-day edits

* Prefer editing **`modules/`** (source)
* Apply changes to your machine via your own linking mechanism
* `sync` only regenerates completions/functions today
* Refresh `home/` via `backup` task when you want to record the current machine state into the Mackup snapshot

Typical loop:

```bash
# edit source modules
$EDITOR modules/...

# apply/link to live system
mise run sync

# snapshot changes into home/ via Mackup + inventories
mise run backup
```

### 2) New machine bootstrap

Typical flow:

```bash
mise run init
mise run restore
mise run sync
```

Where:

* `init` sets up baseline tooling
* `restore` pulls the Mackup snapshot into the correct locations
* `sync` regenerates shell completions/functions (no module linking in repo)

### 3) Host snapshots

Host snapshots live under:

```text
generated/docs/<hostname>/
```

Examples:

* `brew_dump.txt`, `brew_installed.txt`, `brew_leaves.txt`
* `applications.txt`, `setapp.txt`
* `gh_extensions.txt`

These are intentionally host-specific and are expected to change over time.
They are snapshot artifacts (brew/apps/gh extensions, etc.), not canonical config.
